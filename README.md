# Tic-Tac-Toe with AI

This project is a learning exercise based on the tutorial from [Real Python: Tic-Tac-Toe AI in Python](https://realpython.com/tic-tac-toe-ai-python/). The code and architecture followed in this repository are based on the tutorial, which I used to learn how to implement AI for a simple game. The aim was to understand the basic principles of AI and game development using Python.

### Purpose
The main goal of this project was to understand and practice the implementation of **game logic** and **AI algorithms** (specifically the Minimax algorithm) in a simple, well-known game like Tic-Tac-Toe. I now feel comfortable applying these concepts to more complex projects, including commercial solutions.

### What I Learned
- **Minimax algorithm**: How to implement this algorithm to create an AI that can play optimally.
- **Game development in Python**: Gained hands-on experience in building a simple game with Python and implementing logic to control the flow of the game.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The design of the Tic-Tac-Toe game using OOP principles, which can be extended and modified easily.
- **Testing AI functionality**: Ensuring that the AI makes the best possible moves and providing an interface to play against it.

### Features
- Play Tic-Tac-Toe with a human opponent or against an AI.
- The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** to make optimal moves.
- A simple and user-friendly text interface for interacting with the game.

### Next Steps
- Extend the game with a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like **Tkinter** or **PyQt**.
- Add different difficulty levels for the AI.
- Improve the AI's performance for larger board sizes, such as 4x4 or 5x5.

### Disclaimer

While the code in this repository is based on a tutorial, I have learned and understood the key principles, and I am capable of applying the same techniques to more complex projects. This serves as an example of my understanding of **AI algorithms** and how I can implement them in real-world applications.
